Mission to Mars: Web Scraping, HTML, CSS, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Mongo and Flask

## Overview

* The aim of this project is to create a webpage that scrapes the latest data about Mars. It also displays images of Mars. 
* The webpage also includes a facts table comparing Earth and Mars.

## Results

* The webpage is mobile-responsive which allows the data to be displayed properly on smaller devices.
* The HTML code was altered so as to be able to display the images of the hemipheres as thumbnails(changed to "col-md-3", from "col-md-6"). 
* The Mars Facts table column sizes were adjusted to achieve a better display (changed to "col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-md-4" from "col-md-4")
